      <p>How far can we go? This is the pivotal question and push of our time. In every industry from diet fads, to space exploration, there seems to be no end to the lengths human-kind will go to in order to run further, fly higher, and compute faster? Hello! I'mm Laura McCormick, and welcome to the webpage I embarked on designing as I began my full-stack developer course with IBM and Coursera, my official space to show off my abilities.

      <p> And wow, has it evolved over time.
      </p>
      <p>This year I consolodated my strengths in consuming information, language comprehension, as well as my desire to help build the next phase of the world, and turned my attention to learning the skills necessary to help move us into the future;data analysis, back and front-end development, and project management. This is an effort to be able to showcase my skills and completely change my career trajectory.

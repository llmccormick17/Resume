      <p> Welcome to the webpage I embarked on designing as I began my full-stack developer course with IBM and Coursera, my official space to show off my abilities. 
      </p>
      <p> And wow, has it evolved over time.
      </p>
      <p>This year I consolodated my strengths in consuming information, language comprehension, as well as my desire to help build the next phase of the world, and turned my attention to learning the skills necessary to help moe us into the future;data analysis, back and front-end development, and project management. This is an effort to be able to showcase my skills and completely change my career trajectory. 
      </p>
      <p> This HTML based resume is testiment to itself that I have learned how to build the most basic of webpage based interactions, but how do I delve further into the buk of my skills?
